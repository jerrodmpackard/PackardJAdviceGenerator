Advice Generator in React
Created an advice generator web app using React and TypeScript utilizing an advice API
Peer reviewed by: Waqas Dad
Peer review comments: The project is built in react and typescript. The advice # and the advice text displays on the website inside of the box. The button is displayed but is not working. However, when you refresh page, the advice # and the advice text change on display. The page just needs a little styling and it should be good. Good job!
